### About versions

The master branch supports only v0.7 and greater.

For Julia v0.6.3, install the version tagged `v0.3.0`. Compared to the `jv0.5only`
branch, a few features are disabled due to changes between v0.5 and v0.6.2. Three percent of the tests fail.

For Julia v0.5, install branch `jv0.5only`. No development is done on this branch,
only fixes for changing dependencies.

Most of Symata's functionality in Julia v0.5 is preserved in v0.6.
Almost all functionality lost has been regained in upgrading from v0.6 to v0.7-beta.
Approximately 200 more tests pass on v0.7-beta than on v0.6.

NOTE: The syntax for `PatternTest` has been changed, but is not reflected in
many examples, such as the Jupyter notebooks.
See "./sjtest/pattern_test.sj" for information on the new syntax.

### Symata is

- a language for symbolic computations and mathematics, where, for
the most part, "mathematics" means what it typically
does for a scientist or engineer.

- a language based mostly on expressions, on "evaluating" and
rewriting them, like Wolfram, Maple, or Maxima. It is neither a language,
nor an extension of a language, that is mostly procedural, or designed
around data types and functions, or a hierarchy of classes, etc.,
like C or Python or Java. Nor is it language like Sage;
that is, one meant to provide a unifying interface to a number of
mathematics languages with various programming models.

- meant to be useful to people who do not like to program computers, as
well as those who do. The former includes people who prefer not to
think about classes, methods, objects, dispatch, stack traces, etc.

Symata is largely modeled on the pattern matching and evaluation sequence of
Mathematica. Evaluation, pattern matching, flow control, etc. are
written in Julia. Much of the mathematics and symbolic manipulation is
achieved by wrapping SymPy. There are more than 500 functions
implemented, including integration, transformation of special
functions, expression manipulation, writing and reading expressions to
and from a file etc. These are the best places for examples and help:

-  [static snapshots of Symata tutorial notebooks](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jlapeyre/Symata.jl/tree/master/examples/).
   (If you can't get to the nbviewer link, here is [the example directory](examples/) at github.
-  Symata functions written in Symata are [here](symsrc/autoloaded.sj).
-  examples are in [the test directory](sjtest/)  (note this is `sjtest`, not `test`)
-  when running Symata
 * `TAB` completion
 * `? Topic` (with completion)
 * `h"word"` regular expression search

### NEW: Mathematica syntax.

You can use Symata with Mathematica syntax in addition to the usual Julia-like syntax. To use Mathematica syntax,
install the [SymataSyntax.jl package](https://github.com/jlapeyre/SymataSyntax.jl).

### IJulia Notebooks

A few tutorial notebooks can be viewed [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jlapeyre/Symata.jl/tree/master/examples/).
Lower-quality renderings of the same notebooks are in [the example directory](examples/). These are all snapshots, not live, so you can
view them immediately with your browswer.

In order to run the examples in the notebooks, you need to use the development version of `Symata`
Switch to the development version with `Pkg.checkout("Symata")`. (Later, you can return to the latest versioned
branch with `Pkg.free("Symata")`.)

### Installing

Symata is a registered module. It can be installed like this

```julia
julia> Pkg.update()
julia> Pkg.add("Symata")
julia> using Symata
symata> Help()    # type '=' alone on a line to enter symata mode
```

`Symata` can be installed on Linux, OSX, and Windows, and Julia v0.5, and v0.6.

`Symata` depends on the [`PyCall`](https://github.com/stevengj/PyCall.jl) package and
the python [`sympy`](http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) module.
When you load `Symata` with `using Symata`, `sympy` is installed automatically via `PyCall`, which uses [`Conda`](https://github.com/JuliaPy/Conda.jl).
However, to do this, `PyCall` must be configured to not use you system version of `python`.
If you do not have `PyCall` installed, do this

```julia
julia> ENV["PYTHON"]=""
julia> Pkg.add("PyCall")
```

If you *do* have `PyCall` installed, but it is configured to use your system `python`, reconfigure
it like this.

```julia
julia> ENV["PYTHON"]=""
julia> Pkg.build("PyCall")
```

If you use linux, you may have your distribution's `sympy` package installed and it may be
out of date. In this case, try the procedure above, and/or try removing your distribution's `sympy` package.

#### note

`SymPy`, or `sympy`, here refers to the python [SymPy](http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) distribution
(sometimes called sympy), *not* the Julia package `SymPy`. `Symata` does not require the Julia package
[SymPy.jl](https://github.com/jverzani/SymPy.jl), which has a different goal.

Symata requires `mpmath` package for python. This
should be automatically installed when installing `sympy` via
`PyCall` as described above. This also works on OSX.
However, if you use `pip`, you should just be able to run `pip
install mpmath`.

### Running Symata

Three environments for running `Symata` are supported: the `Julia` REPL, `Jupyter`, and a dumb terminal

### Symata REPL mode

A `Symata` mode is added to the `Julia` REPL. Enter the mode by typing `=` as the first character. Exit
the mode by typing `backspace` as the first character.

```julia
julia> using Symata

symata 1>     # after entering `=`
```

There is also an executable [`symata`](symata) included in top level directory of this distribution. It is a (UNIX
sh) shell script that just starts julia and loads the module.

```sh
#
julia -i -e "using Symata" $*
```

Upon running this script, `Symata` mode is entered automatically.
Toggle between Julia and Symata modes by typing `=` as the first character on a line.
(If loading Symata from the `julia` prompt via `using Symata`, you use `=` and backspace.)

In Symata mode, the input is not interpreted as Julia expressions, but rather Symata expressions.
You can do tab completion to see a list of functions and symbols.

### Jupyter / IJulia

Versions v1.3.0 through v1.3.2 of `IJulia.jl` are supported.

```julia
In [1]:  using Symata

In [2]:  Expand((a+b)^2)

Out[2]:  a^2 + 2a*b + b^2

In [3]:  Julia()   # return to Julia mode
```

In `Jupyter`, the `Symata` expressions `In(n)` and `Out(n)` reevaluate the input and output cells. TAB completion
works in `Jupyter`. To see a list of all possible completions, type `*[TAB]`.

### Dumb terminal

If you do `using Symata` in a dumb terminal, the `Symata` prompt should appear automatically.

### sympy shell

From the julia prompt, type `isympy()` to enter the sympy shell.

### Help, examples, tests


The best source of examples is [the test directory](sjtest/).
The documentation can be printed from within Symata by entering `? SymName`
at the `symata` prompt.  `Help(Symname)` prints the same
documentation. For many Symata functions, the SymPy docstring is
printed along with the Symata documentation.

Try `Help()`. Type `h"topic"` to search for items containing the
string `"topic"`.  Hit `TAB` at the command line REPL for a list of all
builtin symbols. (i.e. variables and functions) Symbols that are
associated with some functionality can be listed with
`BuiltIns()`. Type `Example()` to see a list of topics with examples.
Type `Example(topic)` to run the examples. (But, far more examples are
in [the test directory](sjtest/) ). The input strings from the examples are pushed
to the history so that they can be recalled and edited and
re-evaluated.

##### Tests

Run the test suite from the `symata` prompt with `Tests()`.
This runs tests in [the directory sjtest.](sjtest/)
`Pkg.test("Symata")` runs the same test suite from `Julia`.
